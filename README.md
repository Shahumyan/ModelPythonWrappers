# Python Wrappers for Model Coupling

It is an expensive and time-consuming task to develop a new model. Furthermore, a single model often cannot provide answers required for complex decision making based on multiple criteria. Coupling models are often applied to make use of existing models and analyze complex policy questions. These Python wrappers were developed to loosely couple land use (SILO), land cover (CBLCM), transportation (MSTM), and emission models (MEM & BEM) developed in different environments. ArcGIS Model Builder can be used to provide a graphical user interface and to present the modelsâ€™ workflow. The suggested approach is especially efficient when the models are developed in different programming languages, their source codes are not available, or the licensing restrictions make other coupling approaches impractical.
